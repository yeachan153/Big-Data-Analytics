In this folder, I changed the sentiment scores to the old one in the model for:

- Conscientiousness
- Agreebleness

I also changed the coefficients that were removed through backward selection, because once we use old sentiment scores these coefficients change. Doing so increased the adjusted R^2 for both the models above by around 0.04.
